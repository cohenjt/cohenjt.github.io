## Object-Based Evaluation of Marine Heatwave Predictions
I use [Ocetrac](https://github.com/ocetrac/ocetrac){:target="_blank"} and the Method for Object-based Diagnostic Evaluation (MODE) to detect and verify marine heatwave predictions in the CESM2 Seasonal-to-Multiyear Large Ensemble (SMYLE).

My research was highlighted in the Development Testbed Center's [Autumn 2024 Newsletter](https://dtcenter.org/news/2024/04/expansion-mode-applications), and the manuscript was recently accepted in Geophsyical Research Letters.

## Biogeochemical Impacts of the 2019 Northeast Pacific Marine Heatwave
We study the surface and subsurface impacts of the Blob 2.0, a marine heatwave in the Gulf of Alaska that peaked in the summer of 2019. We evaluate temperature, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and dissolved oxygen (DO) to understand the relationships between extreme temperatures and biogeochemistry at the ocean surface and at depth.

## Software
I am a maintainer of [Ocetrac](https://github.com/ocetrac/ocetrac){:target="_blank"}, which uses image processing in python to detect and track spatially connected objects in gridded data. I also contributed to the development of [heatwave3](https://robwschlegel.github.io/heatwave3/index.html){:target="_blank"}, an R package that detects marine heatwaves from time series in NetCDF files. Please reach out if you are interested in using or contributing to these software packages!
