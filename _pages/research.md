My master's work studies air-sea interaction on monthly timescales using satellite data from 1993-2019. With Dr. LuAnne Thompson, I examine the lagged-correlation relationships between sea surface temperature (SST), sea surface height (SSH) and surface turbulent heat flux (Q) to study upper ocean heat content variability and air-sea interaction. I define SST-Q and SSH-Q feedbacks, which estimates the strength of atmospheric feedback to SST anomalies and to upper ocean heat content. I then define an effective depth of air-sea interaction (H), which describes the depth of the ocean that participates in the exchange of heat with the atmosphere. I also examine the ratio of the effective depth to the maximum mixed-layer depth (R) to estimate the renewal rate of the mixed-layer heat content from interior ocean processes relative to that from atmospherically driven surface fluxes. We find large values of H and R in regions with strong ocean currents such as the Gulf Stream, the Kuroshio Current, and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, while interior subtropical regions exhibit small values. We also examine the seasonal dependence of R and find that wintertime R exhibits similar results to the year round R, while in summer, the results are not robust within the midlatitude western boundary currents. This analysis will improve our understanding of the relationship between upper ocean transport processes and surface heat flux variability and enhance our predictive understanding of climate variability.

Dr. Thompson and I have two papers in progress, one focusing on the effective depth of air-sea interaction in the Gulf Stream and one focusing on the seasonality of global air-sea interaction.

# Future work

My upcoming work will focus on studying upper ocean heat content variability by examining surface variables and heat budgets in various models. One approach of my research will focus on defining clusters of air-sea interaction from lagged correlations between SST and Q and between SLA and Q. I will then evaluate model-derived heat budgets within each cluster to study the ocean heat transport processes that dominate air-sea interaction. This research will improve the ability to predict climate changes by better understanding the roles and interactions of the ocean and the atmosphere.
