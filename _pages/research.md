# Marine Heatwaves

I research the spatiotemporal evolution, predictability, and impacts of marine heatwaves. [See more...](https://cohenjt.github.io/research/mhw/)


# Sea Ice Prediction

I research Arctic sea ice predictability. [See more...](https://cohenjt.github.io/research/sea-ice/)


# Earth System Predictability Across Timescales (ESPAT)

My research covers multiple aspects of Earth system predictability and connects with the ESPAT initiative at NSF NCAR. [See more...](https://cohenjt.github.io/research/espat/)


# Air-Sea Interaction

I research the ocean's role in driving the surface heat flux feedback on monthly timescales. [See more...](https://cohenjt.github.io/research/air-sea/)
