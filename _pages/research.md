# Marine Heatwaves

### Object-Based Evaluation of Marine Heatwave Predictions
I use [Ocetrac](https://ocetrac.readthedocs.io/en/latest/){:target="_blank"} and the Method for Object-based Diagnostic Evaluation (MODE) to detect and verify marine heatwave predictions in the CESM2 Seasonal-to-Multiyear Large Ensemble (SMYLE).

My research was recently highlighted in the Development Testbed Center's [Autumn 2024 Newsletter](https://dtcenter.org/news/2024/04/expansion-mode-applications). We are about to submit a manuscript to Geophsyical Research Letters.

### Biogeochemical Impacts of the 2019 Northeast Pacific Marine Heatwave
I am contributing to a publication on the surface and subsurface impacts of the Blob 2.0, a MHW in the Gulf of Alaska that peaked in the summer of 2019. We evaluate temperature, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and dissolved oxygen (DO) to understand the relationships between temperature and biogeochemistry at the ocean surface and at depth.

# Air-Sea Interaction

### The relative roles of oceanic and atmospheric processes in driving air-sea interaction

My master's work studies air-sea interaction on monthly timescales using satellite data from 1993-2019. With Dr. LuAnne Thompson, I examine the lagged-correlation relationships between sea surface temperature (SST), mixed-layer heat content (HC) and surface turbulent heat flux (Q) to study upper ocean heat content variability and air-sea interaction. I define SST-Q and HC-Q feedbacks, which estimates the strength of atmospheric feedback to SST anomalies and to upper ocean heat content. I then define an effective depth of air-sea interaction (H), which describes the depth of the ocean that participates in the exchange of heat with the atmosphere. I also examine the ratio of the effective depth to the maximum mixed-layer depth (R) to estimate the renewal rate of the mixed-layer heat content from interior ocean processes relative to that from atmospherically driven surface fluxes. We find large values of H and R in regions with strong ocean currents such as the Gulf Stream, the Kuroshio Current, and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, while interior subtropical regions exhibit small values. This analysis will improve our understanding of the relationship between upper ocean transport processes and surface heat flux variability and enhance our predictive understanding of climate variability.

I will soon submit a manuscript with Prof. Thompson on this research.
