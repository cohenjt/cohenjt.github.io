    <h1>Program on Climate Change</h1>
    <p>I served on the <a href="https://pcc.uw.edu" target="_blank">Program on Climate Change</a> (PCC) Graduate Steering Committee (<a href="https://pcc.uw.edu/people/graduate-student-steering-committee/" target="_blank">P-GraSC</a>) for two years, during which I worked to engage undergraduate students and local communities on topics related to climate science. With the P-GraSC undergraduate research subcommittee, I created resources for students interested in climate change research and helped provide a space for them to connect and learn from each other. We successfully started the first <a href="https://pcc.uw.edu/research/undergraduate-climate-cohort/" target="_blank">Undergraduate Climate Cohort</a> in 2021 and hosted quarterly events to bring undergraduates together to learn about climate science.</p>

    <h1>ACORN</h1>
    <p>The <a href="https://pcc.uw.edu/research/acorn-program/" target="_blank">Actionable Community-Oriented Research eNgagement</a> (ACORN) program at the University of Washington serves to connect graduate students and community organizations to address community-driven climate and energy priorities. As a member of the ACORN leadership board from 2021-2022, I reached out to community organizations and provide resources to ACORN volunteers and project liasons. I served as the ACORN liaison for the <a href="https://www.cleanenergytransition.org" target="_blank">Clean Energy Transition Institute</a> which hosted projects for six graduate students.</p>

    <h1>Graduate Climate Conference</h1>
    <p>I  served on the organizing committee for the <a href="https://graduateclimateconference.github.io" target="_blank">Graduate Climate Conference</a> (GCC), which brings together graduate students from around the world to share their climate research and to connect graduate students studying climate science. In 2020, I led the Recording & Evaluation committee for the <a href="https://pcc.uw.edu/blog/2020/11/06/gcc-2020/" target="_blank">first virtual GCC</a>. In 2021, I served as a conference co-chair and led the Abstracts committee. In 2022, I created the conference website linked above and led the Abstracts committee again.</p>

- __Summer Committee for Social and Environmental Justice__
    - I served on a committee led by the UW Campus Sustainability Fund and the UW Resilience Lab to fund racial and environmental justice projects within our community. We provided nearly $20,000 in funding for 8 projects, including a project to understand the climate resilience strategies of frontline communities in the Puget Sound region and three seminar series on environmental and racial inequities on topics pertaining to the Nutritional Sciences Program, the School of Art, Division of Art History, and the Department of Atmospheric Sciences.
- __Climate Change // Curiosity Expo__
    - I led an exhibit at the Pacific Science Center to engage with community members and teach about the sources of Arctic Ocean water.
