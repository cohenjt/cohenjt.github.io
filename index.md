## I study air-sea interaction, upper ocean heat content variability, marine heatwaves, and climate predictability.

I am a Ph.D. student studying physical oceanography with [Dr. LuAnne Thompson](https://www.ocean.washington.edu/home/LuAnne+Thompson){:target="_blank"}. My research focuses on air-sea interaction, climate variability, and climate predictability. I use satellite observations to study air-sea heat exchange on monthly and seasonal timescales in order to understand the relative roles of oceanic and atmospheric processes in renewing upper ocean heat content. I use hindcast models like the Seasonal-to-Multiyear Large Ensemble (SMYLE) to study and understand predictions of marine heatwaves and Arctic sea ice. I also am interested in climate justice, community engagement, and climate data science.

Before coming to the University of Washington in September 2019, I earned a B.A. in Physics from Carleton College in June 2019.

I am currently applying and looking for postdoc research opportunities focused on ocean heat variability and/or subseasonal to seasonal climate prediction!
