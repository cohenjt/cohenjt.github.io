I am a Ph.D. student studying physical oceanography with [Dr. LuAnne Thompson](https://www.ocean.washington.edu/home/LuAnne+Thompson){:target="_blank"}. My research focuses on air-sea interaction and climate variability. I use satellite observations to study air-sea heat exchange on monthly and seasonal timescales in order to understand the relative roles of oceanic and atmospheric processes in renewing upper ocean heat content. 

Before coming to the University of Washington in September 2019, I earned a B.A. in Physics from Carleton College in June 2019.
