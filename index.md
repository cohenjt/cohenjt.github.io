I am a Ph.D. student studying physical oceanography with Dr. LuAnne Thompson. My research focuses on air-sea interaction and climate variability, primarily in the Southern Ocean. I use satellite observations to study air-sea heat exchange on monthly, seasonal, and interannual timescales in order to understand the relative roles of oceanic and atmospheric processes in renewing upper ocean heat content. I presented the preliminary findings of this research at the 2020 Graduate Climate Conference and the 2020 AGU Fall Meeting, and plan to submit a manuscript with more findings soon.

Before coming to the University of Washington in September 2019, I earned a B.A. in Physics from Carleton College in June 2019.

As a member of the Program on Climate Change Graduate Steering Committee (P-GraSC), I work to engage undergraduate students, public audiences, and local communities on topics related to climate science. With the P-GraSC undergraduate research subcommittee, I create resources for students interested in climate change research and help provide a space for them to connect and learn from each other. With the public engagement subcommittee, I organize seminar series on climate change topics for public audiences. I also am on the executive organizing committee of the Actionable Community-Oriented Research eNgagement (ACORN) program, which connects graduate students with community organizations to address community climate and energy priorities.

Last fall, I served on the organizing committee for the 14th annual Graduate Climate Conference, which brought together graduate students from across the world to share their climate research and connect graduate students studying climate science.
