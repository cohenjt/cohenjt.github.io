## I study air-sea interaction, upper ocean heat content variability, and climate variability.

I am a Ph.D. student studying physical oceanography with [Dr. LuAnne Thompson](https://www.ocean.washington.edu/home/LuAnne+Thompson){:target="_blank"}. My research focuses on air-sea interaction and climate variability. I use satellite observations to study air-sea heat exchange on monthly and seasonal timescales in order to understand the relative roles of oceanic and atmospheric processes in renewing upper ocean heat content. I also am interested in climate justice, community engagement, and climate data science.

Before coming to the University of Washington in September 2019, I earned a B.A. in Physics from Carleton College in June 2019.
